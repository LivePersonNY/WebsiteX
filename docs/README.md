## Overview

* Each page has its own card.
* Subsequent issues are tracked within these cards.
* The only time a card will move _back_ through the board is from **final review** to *edits pending*.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

### NPM
Install Node and NPM per their individual documentation.

### Composer
Install composer globally on your machine per documentation.

### Git
Duh.

## Gatsby CLI

```bash
npm i gatsby-cli -g
```

## Docsify CLI

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

# Development

## Running Wordpress locally

This is only necessary when doing php/wordpress development. For local development, a sqlite database will be established automatically.

```bash
composer wordpress
```

When you run this for the first time and visit localhost:3000, you will be prompted to choose a language and create some site settings.
