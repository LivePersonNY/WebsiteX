                <h2>Convenience is KING</h2>
                <p>Consumers today favor brands who make it easy for them to do business with, while simultaneously providing personalized experiences. A study by McKinsey & Company found that upwards of 80 percent of consumers want personalized experiences from brands.<br /><br />
                But delivering both convenience and hyper-personalization can be difficult as both have traditionally required devoting large amounts of your employees' time on handling customer inquiries. Conversational AI can help you scale these hyper-personalized experiences across your entire customer base.<br /><br />
                Rather than hunting on a website for product info,  Conversational AI enables consumers to simply state their intent, while being able to personalize each consumer's digital journey, at scale.<br /><br />
                And messaging is the best medium to employ Conversational AI, as messaging apps are already the preferred communication channel that we all use today with family and friends. Consumers no longer have to call an 800 number and wait on hold, just to speak to a person for simple requests like checking if a product is in stock or changing a billing address.</p>

                <h3>01. Double your online sales with messaging</h3>
                <p>Give consumers on your website the ability to ask product questions or get help completing a purchase through messaging. Then integrate bots in order to offer 24/7 support, reducing cart abandonment and improving sales conversion rates.<br /><br />
                E-commerce websites and apps are great for housing information, but it is often time-consuming and cumbersome for customers to find the exact product information they are looking for. A conversational interface solves this by allowing customers to immediately state their intent, skipping the process whereby a customer would need to search for the answers they need before making a purchase.<br /><br />
                LivePerson customers using messaging and automation for sales use cases are seeing conversion rates up to 10 times higher than when consumers are left to self-serve. Applying a similar conversion rate improvement would yield $135.67M in incremental revenue.</p>
